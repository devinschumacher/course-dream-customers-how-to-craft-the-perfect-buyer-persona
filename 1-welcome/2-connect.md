# Connect to succeed

To get the most out of the course, I highly recommend you participate in at least some of the following places:

1. Subscribe to the [Youtube channel](https://serp.ly/@devinschumacher/youtube) - for additional content, live streams, request videos you want me to make, and drop comments (I respond there quickly and always answer questions!)
2. Sign up for the [email list](https://serp.ly/@devin/email) - this is where you'll get direct announcement of new releases (products, courses, etc. that I am consistently launching, and 99.9% of the time they are 100% free). Actually i think they have been 100% of the time free so far... But THE BIGGEST STUFF ALWAYS DROPS THERE FIRST!
3. Join the [community](https://serp.ly/@serp/community) - and @tag me with any questions!
